The template for the file has to be written in YAML 1.1 with this syntax :

A template file is a list of YAML map (called here FIELD) representing its fields.

Example :

- FIELD
- FIELD
- ...

or 

[ FIELD , FIELD...] (but it's less readable).


A field map must have at least the "type" attribute set with the type of the field
(if the "type" attribute is not set, the field will be ignored). The possible types
are described in the Field_Types.md file.

For example, "type : Number" set the type of the field to Number, meaning that
the user will later enter for this field a number (and not a date for example).

You can add more attribute to the map of the field, some are specific to a
type (if it's set for a wrong type, it will be just ignored), and other are shared
with all types. The former are describe in the file Types_Attributes.md,
and for the later, here's a list :

* name : the name of the field (will be displayed next to the input form of the field).
* value : the value (or default value) of the field. For "Section" types, the value is
a list of field maps.
* properties : a list of properties for the field ( the possible values of the list
are described in the file Properties_Values.md.

Next is a concrete example of a template :


-   type : Number
    name : Question
    value : 42

-   type : String
    name : Test
    value : C'est pas faux
    properties : [ right ]

-   properties : [ bold , left ]
    type : Section
    name : 'Section name'
    value :
    -   type : Label
        value : LABEL_EXAMPLE
    -   type : Date
        value : 13/02/92
